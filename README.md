# laosb's site

This is my personal site, a resume in some sense, but a self introduction and description too.

Not frequently updated. But will be updated when I'm free to do.

The old resume (`/old`) won't be updated anymore.

## Tech things

I'm writing this page from scratch, without any UI frameworks, minifiers, bundlers and view layer frameworks.

This is to keep things simple. Getting too complex on such a easy page is not my cup of tea.
